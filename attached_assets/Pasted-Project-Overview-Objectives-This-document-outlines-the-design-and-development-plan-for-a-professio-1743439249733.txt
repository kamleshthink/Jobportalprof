Project Overview & Objectives
This document outlines the design and development plan for a professional Job Portal web application. The application will enable job seekers to register, create profiles, search for and apply to job postings while allowing employers to post job vacancies, review applicants, and manage their listings. An admin panel will facilitate overall management of users and content. The project leverages a full-stack approach with React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and a NoSQL (MongoDB) or SQL (MySQL) database for persistent storage. This document provides detailed instructions for each part of the project, with every API endpoint or integration point left as a placeholder ([API_ENDPOINT]) for you to fill in later.

1. Frontend – React.js Application

Folder Structure & Project Setup

Create a new React project using Create React App or your preferred boilerplate.

Organize the project into logical folders:

/src/components: Reusable components like Navbar, Footer, JobCard, JobForm, etc.

/src/pages: Pages such as Home, Login, Register, Job Listings, Job Details, Dashboard, and Admin Panel.

/src/services: API service modules where each endpoint call is abstracted; placeholders like [API_ENDPOINT] will be used.

/src/utils: Utility functions (e.g., authentication helpers, date formatting).

/src/context: React Context for global state management (e.g., auth context).

Include styling libraries such as Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap and configure them according to your project’s branding.

UI/UX Design Guidelines

Ensure a responsive layout that adjusts for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Use a modern, clean design with consistent fonts, color schemes, and spacing.

For navigation, design a persistent header with links for Home, Jobs, Login/Signup, and user-specific options (Profile, Dashboard).

Design forms with clear input labels, validation feedback, and a visually appealing submit button.

Component Instructions

Navbar Component:

Should include dynamic links that change based on user authentication and role.

Include a logo area, navigation links, and a user dropdown for profile-related actions.

JobCard Component:

Display job title, company, location, a brief description, and an “Apply” button.

Include a placeholder for onClick behavior that triggers job application actions using [API_ENDPOINT: Job Application API].

JobForm Component:

Used by employers to post new jobs.

Fields should include job title, description, requirements, location, salary, and application deadline.

Form submission should call a placeholder API endpoint [API_ENDPOINT: Create Job].

Authentication Pages (Login/Register):

Design forms that collect user credentials (email, password, name, role selection).

On submission, call [API_ENDPOINT: User Registration/Login].

Provide error handling and loading states.

Dashboard & Profile Pages:

Job seekers see applied jobs, saved jobs, and a profile overview.

Employers view posted jobs and applicant details.

Admin Panel:

Accessible only to admin users; should include dashboards for user management, job management, and reporting.

Design separate sections for reviewing pending employer approvals, flagging job postings, and overall analytics.

State Management & API Integration

Use React Context or Redux for managing authentication states and global data.

Create a central API service file (e.g., apiService.js) that exports functions for each API call. For every function, leave an empty implementation that points to [API_ENDPOINT].

Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
export const fetchJobs = async () => {
  // TODO: Implement API call to fetch jobs from **[API_ENDPOINT: Get Jobs]**
  const response = await fetch("[API_ENDPOINT]");
  return response.json();
};
Ensure that JWT tokens (or your preferred authentication tokens) are stored securely (e.g., in HttpOnly cookies or local storage with proper precautions) and appended in the headers of API requests.

2. Backend – Node.js & Express.js Application

Project Setup & Structure

Initialize a Node.js project and install Express, Mongoose (for MongoDB) or Sequelize (for MySQL), bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, and any other necessary middleware.

Structure the project into directories:

/controllers: For request handlers (e.g., authController, jobController, adminController).

/models: Database schemas/models (User, Job, Application).

/routes: Express routers for different functionalities.

/middlewares: Custom middleware for authentication (e.g., JWT verification), error handling, and logging.

/utils: Utility functions such as API response formatting, error constructors, etc.

Authentication & Authorization

Implement JWT-based authentication. Create endpoints for registration and login:

/api/auth/register: Accepts user data (name, email, password, role). Hash passwords with bcrypt before saving.

/api/auth/login: Validates credentials, signs a JWT, and returns it.

Use middleware (e.g., authMiddleware.js) to protect routes that require authentication.

Place API endpoints as [API_ENDPOINT: Register] and [API_ENDPOINT: Login] for later completion.

Create role-based access control:

Middleware functions to check if the logged-in user is a job seeker, employer, or admin.

Ensure endpoints like posting a job or accessing the admin panel require appropriate roles.

Job Management API Endpoints

Create Job (POST /api/jobs):

Employer-only access.

Endpoint should validate input fields, then create a new job entry in the database.

Leave the actual API endpoint logic marked as [API_ENDPOINT: Create Job].

Get All Jobs (GET /api/jobs):

Open endpoint to list all active jobs.

Include query parameters for filtering by location, job type, or keyword search.

Implementation placeholder [API_ENDPOINT: Get Jobs].

Get Job Details (GET /api/jobs/:id):

Retrieves a specific job's details.

Placeholder [API_ENDPOINT: Get Job Details].

Apply for Job (POST /api/jobs/:id/apply):

Job seekers use this endpoint to apply for a job.

Validate that the user has a valid profile and the job exists.

Mark the endpoint as [API_ENDPOINT: Apply for Job].

Update Job (PUT /api/jobs/:id): and Delete Job (DELETE /api/jobs/:id):

Accessible by the employer who posted the job or an admin.

Ensure proper permission checks; leave placeholders [API_ENDPOINT: Update Job] and [API_ENDPOINT: Delete Job].

Application & Profile Management Endpoints

User Profile Management:

GET /api/users/profile: Retrieve current user profile information.

PUT /api/users/profile: Update user profile details including resume upload (use Multer for file uploads).

Placeholders [API_ENDPOINT: Get Profile] and [API_ENDPOINT: Update Profile].

Job Application Tracking:

Endpoints for users to see the status of their applications and for employers to view applicants for their jobs.

Create endpoints like GET /api/applications/:userId and GET /api/jobs/:jobId/applicants with placeholders [API_ENDPOINT: Get Applications].

Admin Panel Endpoints

User & Job Management:

GET /api/admin/users: List all users for admin review.

PUT /api/admin/users/:id/approve: Approve employer registration or flag a user account.

DELETE /api/admin/users/:id: Remove a user if necessary.

GET /api/admin/jobs: List all jobs including flagged or spam posts.

DELETE /api/admin/jobs/:id: Delete inappropriate or fake job postings.

Mark each as [API_ENDPOINT: Admin User Management], [API_ENDPOINT: Admin Job Management], etc.

Reporting & Analytics:

Create endpoints to generate statistics on job postings, application rates, and active users.

For example, GET /api/admin/reports with placeholder [API_ENDPOINT: Admin Reports].

Middleware & Error Handling

Develop a centralized error handling middleware that captures and formats errors from any API endpoint.

Log all requests and errors for monitoring using a logging library like Winston.

Insert comments in the code for every API endpoint with clear instructions to implement the required functionality later.

3. Database Design

Schema for MongoDB (or Equivalent for MySQL)

Users Collection/Table:

Fields: _id, name, email, password (hashed), role (jobseeker, employer, admin), resume (file path or URL), skills (array), appliedJobs (array of job IDs), createdAt (timestamp), and any additional profile information.

Create indexes on email and role for efficient queries.

Jobs Collection/Table:

Fields: _id, title, company, description, location, salary, requirements, postedBy (employer ID), applicants (array of user IDs or a subdocument with application status), createdAt (timestamp), updatedAt, and status (active, closed).

Ensure text indexes for keyword searches on title and description.

Applications Collection/Table:

Fields: _id, jobId, userId, status (pending, accepted, rejected), appliedAt (timestamp).

You can also embed application details in the Jobs document if using MongoDB, depending on query requirements.

Database Connection & Configuration

In your backend, create a configuration file that securely loads the database URI (or connection string) from environment variables.

For MongoDB, use Mongoose to define schemas and models; for MySQL, consider using Sequelize ORM.

Ensure that your database initialization code is robust with error handling and reconnect logic.

Document every field in the schema with comments explaining its purpose and any validation rules.

4. Admin Panel – Web Interface for Administration

Design & Features

The admin panel should have a dedicated login separate from user authentication.

Features include:

A dashboard with summary statistics (total users, total job posts, pending approvals, recent activity).

User management section where admin can search, filter, and update user accounts.

Job management section for reviewing, editing, or deleting job postings.

Report generation section that aggregates data (e.g., application conversion rates, active job postings per category).

Frontend Implementation for Admin Panel

Create separate React components/pages for each section of the admin panel (e.g., AdminDashboard.js, UserManagement.js, JobManagement.js, Reports.js).

Use protected routes to ensure that only authenticated admin users can access these pages.

Connect to backend admin endpoints with the placeholder [API_ENDPOINT: Admin Panel API].

Provide detailed forms and tables with inline editing capabilities, search filters, and pagination for managing large datasets.

Include instructions in comments within your code for where to insert additional API calls or logic.

Backend Implementation for Admin Panel

Create an Express router for admin functionalities (e.g., adminRoutes.js).

Each route should first check if the request user has an admin role using the middleware.

For every admin operation (approving users, deleting jobs, etc.), add detailed comments describing the expected behavior and then leave a placeholder for the actual business logic (e.g., [API_ENDPOINT: Approve User]).

Ensure that all sensitive operations have logging and proper error handling.

5. Additional Considerations & Deployment Instructions

Security Best Practices

Use HTTPS and secure your endpoints with proper authentication.

Validate and sanitize all incoming data.

Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints.

Store secret keys, API endpoints, and database connection strings in environment variables.

Testing & Quality Assurance

Write unit tests for each controller function using a framework like Jest or Mocha.

Create integration tests for API endpoints to ensure that frontend-backend communication works as expected.

Document each test case with instructions on how to run them and what each test is verifying.

Deployment Strategy

Frontend: Deploy on a service like Vercel or Netlify.

Backend: Use cloud providers such as Heroku, Render, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Database: For MongoDB, use MongoDB Atlas; for MySQL, consider AWS RDS or a similar managed service.

Ensure CI/CD pipelines are in place to automate testing and deployment.

Include comments and placeholders in your deployment configuration files (e.g., Dockerfiles, GitHub Actions workflows) with notes like [DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG] where specific settings need to be inserted.

Documentation & Code Comments

Throughout your code, write clear comments explaining the purpose of functions, routes, and components.

Create a README.md file that details how to set up the project locally, how to run tests, and how to deploy the application.

Wherever an API or integration point is referenced, include a comment marker [API_ENDPOINT] so you can later replace it with the actual URL or logic
